- zombie pirates taken over towns. player tries to survive and decides to save ppl too.
- player starts to build boat, upgrades boat to ship as they progress etc.
- player goes into battle with zombies. saves a few ppl. gets resources to upgrade ship.
- later realises that the zombies are not willing to kill hostages. player finds out how to cure them with a potion,
	but its too late for some of them so player is always under attack.
- hot air balloons passes by, can be shot down for air packages
- player has a companion eagle, used as radar. bird will call direciton for main boss (every 2 seconds for 10seconds maybe):
	north 1 call, east 2 quick-calls, etc

//future upgrades
- hot air baloon passes by carrying tourists, baloon gets shot down (no one knows who but we see an arrow pierce it),
	tourists land on home-island, players recruit. every few heists a balloon gets shot down for recruit.

game starts:
	- player is on a hot air baloon cruising. baloon gets shot down, player wakes up on a small island with
	a broken boat and few resources. fixes the boat.
	- a bit exploration time for player. 
	
player's first controls:
	- sails to nearby small island. encounters first zombies, defeats zombies with stones. finds sword. comes back 
	upgrades boat with new resources.

next new small island:
	- player explores how to use sword etc by defeating more zombies. gets resources, finds a tough string.
	- comes back home, builds a small hut with a ladder.
	- also builds a bow with the found string.

upgrades boat. builds a new weapon.

boat starts to sail:
	- flag goes up. sails rolls out. kayak spades slide out from sides.
	- friendly bots jumping into boat
	- boat horn sound
	- music starts
	- dolphins chase by its side


*ideas*
- rope-pully animation for raising/lowering sail anims
- a mission to go at night while zombies sleeping: first small bboat upto a certain distance,
	then swim the rest, and then player nust sneak not o to wake mass.
